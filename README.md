Welcome to Kinoru's configuration madness!

Pesky copyright probably does not even apply to these files. Browse and cherry-pick whatever you want.

- `install.sh`: Minimum configuration. Sufficient for development (virtual) machines.
- `desktop.sh`: Additional and crazy configuration for Debian/Ubuntu desktops.

I use the text triumvirate of fish, vim, and tmux. All three of them are configured to adapt the Powerline style. [The style for tmux written by Klutzy](https://github.com/klutzy/.../blob/master/.tmux.conf) is minimal yet awesome.
