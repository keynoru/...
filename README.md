Welcome to Kinoru's configuration madness.

Browse and cherry-pick whatever you want.

Notable ones:

- `config.fish` (**WARNING**: highly customized. Read before adopt.)
- `.vimrc`
- `.tmux.conf`

All three of them are configured to the Powerline style.

## Firefox Add-ons

Hopefully someday I can manage these with dotfiles…

- [Advanced Tab Navigation](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/advanced-tab-navigation/): Switch to left, right, previously active tab and more with customizable hotkeys
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> for switching tabs
- [Clean Links](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clean-links/): Converts obfuscated/nested links to genuine clean links
- [Copy Link Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-link-text-4750/): Copy text without the trouble of using the mouse to highlight the text exactly or the annoyance of unintentionally visiting the link.
- [Disable Ctrl-Q Shortcut](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disable-ctrl-q-shortcut/): Seriously, did _browser close_ and _tab close_ have to be next to each other? I'm fine with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>.
- [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/): Pour some grease upon the web page. If this doesn't solve your problem, you're not using enough of it.
    - [jews](https://github.com/disjukr/jews)
    - [나무위키 펼침](https://github.com/kinoru/namuwiki-unfold)
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
- [Restart](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/re-start/): It's really stupid that this is not a built-in function
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): Finally, an efficient blocker.
- [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
- [VimFx](https://github.com/akhodakivskiy/VimFx): Vim keyboard shortcuts for Firefox
    - Disable the "Reload all tabs" key (Who in the right mind would want this?)

## Windows

Sometimes I have to (grudgingly) use Windows. Links below are for such occasions:
